<!--JARLAXLE w/ NAVIR'S PARENTS-->
    <div class = "Villains">
        <h2>Jarlaxle Baenre</h2>
        <img src="Jarlaxle.jpg">
        <p>Jarlaxle -- what's not to like about him? He's a swashbuckling flamboyant drow sailin' around the 
            world. He docked in Waterdeep sometime around the summer on the Sea Maidens Faire. He disguises himself
            and his crew of male drows as humans, with Jarlaxle himself going by the alias Captain Zord.
            His main goal of being in Waterdeep is political influence -- he plans on wiggiling his way 
            into the Lords' Alliance, a confederation of cities and towns that band together to stop 
            common threats. Ontop of this, he gathers intel and information through Nimblewrights, which 
            are constructs he sells in Waterdeep. 

            He's the only villain that technically doesn't know anything about the Enigma, not until 
            it's brought to his attention (intentionally or not). My party approached Captain "Zord" 
            as part of an fireball investigation, and through their interaction, "Zord" managed to
            shift through a specific nimblewright's memory, learning about the Enigma. 

            Shortly after this, he had gotten into contact with a well-known pirate crew searching for their
            run-aways. Lucky for them, jarlaxle just happened to have met them recently, and is willing
            to lend a hand for some good coin...

<!--CASSALANTERNS w/ KYO'S MOTHER(?)-->
    <div class = "Villains">
    <h2>Victoror & Ammalia Cassalanter</h2>
    <img src="Cassalanters.png">
    <p>The Cassalanters are some of the many nobels that call Waterdeep their home. For these two, they 
        also call their little estate their ground for devil worship! These two secretly made a pact
        with Asmodeus, forking over their children's souls for good health, long life, and power. Their eldest
        was taken instantly, transforming him into a chain devil that now stays locked away in the attic. 
        Their two younger children are doomed to meet a similar fate on their 9th birthday. There is a provision
        within their contract that allows The Cassalanters to essentially buy their way out, but it'll take
        a lot of coin (which they've been running out of), and souls. They believe that the Enigma might 
        give them an edge to fufill this contract (least in the coin part -- the souls are straight-up souls).

        The party has only briefly seen that at a party, though Kieran has been making visits to their space
        more frequently as part of his contract. Knowing the party's involvement with the

<!--MANSHOON-->
<div class = "Villains">
    <h2>Manshoon</h2>
    <img src="Manshoon.jpg">
    <p>Many have heard tales of Manshoon, an ancient wizard that founded the original Zhentarim group. Fearing that
        he might one day be annihilated by his enemies (Elminster and Khelben Arunsun, to name a couple), he managed
        to create several clones. And these clones thought that they were better. So they fought each other over it,
         with that whole fiasco being known as the Manshoon Wars. Turns out, one of the clones managed to secretly
         infultrate Waterdeep, and has been holed up in Kolat Towers for years. He's been silently observing the city,
         waiting for the perfect time to strike and take over Waterdeep, declaring himself "Wiard-King of Waterdeep" (2/10, needs
         better name), mainly through bribing and blackmailing the Masked Lords, before turning his 
         sight towards the Undermountain. He believes the Enigma might give him an edge on that endeavor, and 
         uses any Zhentarium who stayed loyal to Manshoon to carry out his plans.

<!--XANATHAR-->
<div class = "Villains">
    <h2>Xanathar</h2>
    <img src="Xanathar.webp" alr="An image of a Beholder">
    <p>The Beholder Crime Lord, slumming within the city's dungeons underneath. He's a paranoid tyrant who 
        charms and bullies his minions to submittion. He has a fondness for riches, and some theories suggest
        that Neverember hid some gold somewhere under the city. His group originally had possession of the Stone 
        before being stolen by someone. Xanathar believes the Zhentarium took it, thus starting the gang war between
        the two. He sees Zhents everywhere he goes, and lashes out on any that he suspects might be related, making
        things within his own gang complicated and strainned.
