<!--CHARACTERS AND PLAYERS--> 

    <div class = "Navir">
        <h2>Navir Natorai</h2>
        <img src="Navir.jpg">
        <p>You wouldn't expect such a smiling face like his to mask tragedy and pain. Nor would you expect that face of his
            to actually NOT be his. Navir was part of the Natorai -- a changeling family well-reknown for their generations of 
            ruthlessness on the seas, their reputation earned by aggression and violence both outside and 
            within the family. He manages to break away from the crew after losing one of his only friends and 
            adopting his face as a way of coping. He now wanders the land as a musicain, taking up
            gigs as an alternative to the old ways of pillaging and destruction. 
            <br><br><br>
            Currently, he resides in Trollskull Mannor, where he co-owns the newly remade tavern with his 
            adventuring party. He mainly acts as the party's chef and "father figure", esspecially to
            a group of orphan kids he insisted of adopting. 
            <br><br><br>
            Navir is played by Vince -- my childhood best friend :D

    <div class = "Kyo">
        <h2>Kyo</h2>
        <img src="Kyo.png">
        <p>Kyo is an odd woman -- she rarely, if ever, speaks. However, you will still know her voice as
            an intrusive thought that's not your own, her perfered way of communication. She was born
            in a community of people like her, people who have a special connection to spirits of their own, some 
            even developing powers from it. 
            This peaceful life was short-lived once Kahlan, her father, had died of poison and Kaia, her mother,
            scorched the village to the ground. Her mother intended for Kyo to be the perfect vessel 
            for the Lord of Nightmares. Kyo escaped the village, and was taken in by the headmaster of a boarding 
            school. After graduating from this school, she managed a job as a private investigator, leading her to a 
            case within Waterdeep concerning two major gangs at war with each other. 
            <br><br><br>
            Currently, she resides in Trollskull, alongside her adventuring party. Recently, she reunited with
            her husband Kieran, grandkid of the headmaster whom she origially met at boarding school. A good amount
            of time, she and Navir have a frienemy relationship.    
            <br><br><br>
            Kyo is played by Claudia, my other best friend :D
