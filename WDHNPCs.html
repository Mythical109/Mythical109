    <!--YESMAE-->
    <div class ="NPC">
        <h2>Yesmae</h2>
        <img src="yesmae.png">
        <p>Yesmae's goals were sraightfoward -- expand her family's business of crafters and tinkering.
            She mainly was part of the original mission to gain some coin for buying some property to start up.
            She eventually stuck with the party in Trollskull mannor, figuring the place can act as both a tavern
            and artificer shop. She usually held the group together, being a sort of mediator between Navir and Kyo.
            Yesmae, unfortunaltely, was killed from a fireball incident while taking the kids out to see a holiday event
            early in the morning.

    <!--KIERAN WARNER-->

    <div class = "NPC">
        <h2>Kieran Warner</h2>
        <img src="Kieran.png">
        <p>Kieran was the middle child of the Warner family, who's riches and success brought him
            comfort for most of his earlier days in school. He met Kyo, later to be his wife, here. Eventually,
            the two seperated towards the end of school after Kieran was pulled out to continue the "family business" --
            that business being devil worship. Turns out his family is contracted to Asmodeus, and a specific generation
            is chosen to serve the archdevil out in Faerun. This responsibility fell onto him, and he left to carry on
            the sins of his ancestors. As of right now, he managed to find Kyo in Waterdeep, and moved in with the party.
            His contract, however, is straining him between protecting his wife and furthering the archdevil's follower's schemes.

    <!--NELFI-->
    <div class = "NPC">
        <h2>Nelfi Natorai</h2>
        <img src="Nelfi.png">
        <p>Nelfi was part of the Natorai family, elder sister to Navir. Not much is known of her past specifically, 
            but given how she's staryed from her family, it's safe to assume that she's had similar experiences to Navir
            and does not really enjoy the idea of meeting them again.

    <div class = "NPC">
        <h2>Orphan Kids</h2>
        <img src="kids.jpg" alt = "An illustration of three kids lined yup in a row">
        <p>This trio has stuck with each other for quite a while. They mainly hung around Trollskull Alley,
            squatting in the abandonded mannor and claiming it to be the base of operations for the Trouser Troope.
             The party decided to take the kids in after gainning ownership of the mannor, and the troope has been 
             calling it home ever since. 
            <br><br>
             From left to right:
            <br><br>
            Jenks -- the troope's designated wizard (not actually a wizard). Tends to be the reserved
            and shy one of the group. His make-shift plushie is his "familiar" named Waffles.
            <br><br>
            Nat -- the troope's official leader. She's the fighter of the group and is deaf, so she communicates
            via sign language. She's stern and straightfoward, but can joke around from time to time. 
            <br><br>
            Squiddly -- the troope's ranger. He's the most outspoken and rash. He also tends to be the most 
            energetic.
